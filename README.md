## Purpose of Code

This repository is part of a publication. It is created to calculate currrents using the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism for systems with onsite Coulomb Interactions in the Hartree-Fock and Hubbard One approximation.

The scattering region considered has a bipartite lattice. The leads are modelled in the wide-band limit (WBL) or they are modelled as semi-infinite (SIF) leads.
